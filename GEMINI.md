## Project: C-UCP Framework

The C-UCP (Compatible Unified Coherence Protocol) Framework is a project designed to enhance the coherence and logical consistency of AI systems during extended conversations. It provides a structured protocol (C-UCP v2.0) and a methodology for testing its effectiveness.

### Key Components:

*   **C-UCP v2.0 Protocol:** A set of principles and operational laws for an AI to follow, including automated "anti-drift" mechanisms to maintain coherence over time. This is detailed in `C-UCP_enhanced-anti-drift-version.md`.
*   **Testing Methodology:** A standardized procedure for comparing an AI's performance with and without the C-UCP protocol. This involves a set of test scenarios and assessment metrics. The methodology is described in `cucp_methodology.md` and a "paste-ready" version for execution is in `cucp_methodology_paste-ready.md`.
*   **Test Results:** A summary of a test conducted with "Claude 4 Sonnet" is available in `cucp_test_summary_claude-4-sonnet.md`. The results show improvements in "Recursion Depth," "Resonance Frequency," and "Coherence Consistency."

### How to Work with this Project:

*   To **understand the protocol**, read `C-UCP_enhanced-anti-drift-version.md`.
*   To **run a test**, use the prompts in `cucp_methodology_paste-ready.md`.
*   To **understand the test results**, see `cucp_test_summary_claude-4-sonnet.md`.

The project aims to provide a practical framework for improving AI coherence in analytical and complex problem-solving tasks.
